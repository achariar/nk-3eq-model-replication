## üìå Purpose

This project provides a Julia-based replication of the canonical New Keynesian 3-equation model using:

- [`MacroModelling.jl`](https://github.com/IMFS-MMB/MacroModelling.jl) ‚Äì for solving DSGE models
- [`StatsPlots.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/StatsPlots.jl) ‚Äì for visualizing impulse response functions and results

The original Dynare/MATLAB code is translated into idiomatic Julia code using modern macroeconomic modeling tools.  
It is particularly suited for students, researchers, and instructors seeking transparent and reproducible macroeconomic model implementations.

## üìò Model Description

We implement a simple dynamic New Keynesian model composed of:

### 1: Phillips Curve

The New Keynesian Phillips Curve (PC) links current inflation $\hat{\pi}_t$ to expected future inflation $E_t\{\hat{\pi}_{t+1}\}$, the output gap $\hat{y}_t$, and a cost-push shock $\varepsilon_t^s$:

$$
\hat{\pi}_t = \beta E_t \left\{ \hat{\pi}_{t+1} \right\} + \kappa \hat{y}_t + \varepsilon_t^s.
$$

### 2: IS Curve

The dynamic IS curve is a log-linearization of the Euler equation that describes the intertemporal allocation of consumption by agents in the economy:

$$
\hat{y}_t = E_t \left\{ \hat{y}_{t+1} \right\} - \frac{1}{\sigma} \left( \hat{r}_t - E_t \left\{ \hat{\pi}_{t+1} \right\} \right) + \varepsilon_t^D.
$$

### 3: Monetary Policy Rule

The monetary policy schedule (MP) is based on the Taylor rule. It links the nominal interest rate $\hat{r}_t$, which is controlled by the monetary authority, to inflation $\hat{\pi}_t$ and the output gap $\hat{y}_t$:

$$
\hat{r}_t = \phi^{\pi} \hat{\pi}_t + \phi^{y} \hat{y}_t + \varepsilon_t^R.
$$

The shock term follows an AR(1) process:

$$
\varepsilon_t^R = \rho_R \varepsilon_{t-1}^R + \eta_t^R, \quad \eta_t^R \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_R^2)
$$

## ‚öôÔ∏è Model Implementation in Julia

### 1. Model Equations

```julia
@model NKThree begin
    # IS curve
    y[0]   = y[1] - (1/œÉ) * (r[0] - pi[1]) + s_D[0]

    # Phillips curve
    pi[0]  = Œ≤*pi[1] + ((1-Œ∏)*(1-Œ≤*Œ∏)/Œ∏)*(œÉ+œÜ)*y[0] + s_S[0]

    # Taylor rule
    r[0]   = œÅ*r[-1] + (1-œÅ)*(œÜ_œÄ*pi[0] + œÜ_y*y[0]) + s_r[0]

    # Shock processes
    s_D[0] = œÅ_D*s_D[-1] + e_D[x]
    s_S[0] = œÅ_S*s_S[-1] + e_S[x]
    s_r[0] = œÅ_R*s_r[-1] + e_R[x]
end
```

### 2. Calibration Parameters 

```julia
@parameters NKThree begin
    Œ≤      = 0.99
    œÉ      = 1.0
    œÜ      = 1.0
    Œ∏      = 3/4
    Œµ      = 6.0
    œÅ      = 0.0
    œÜ_œÄ    = 1.5
    œÜ_y    = 0.5/4
    œÅ_D    = 0.9
    œÅ_S    = 0.9
    œÅ_R    = 0.4
